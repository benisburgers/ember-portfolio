          When I was 18, I moved to Canada to study International Relations at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
          After graduating in 2018, I began to work outdoors.
          Specifically, I worked as a rafting guide, ski instructor, and hiking guide in the Swiss Alps and the Rocky Mountains.

          When not outside, I taught myself how to use <span class="strong">HTML</span>, <span class="strong">CSS</span>, <span class="strong">Javascript</span>, and <span class="strong">GIT</span>.
          In January 2019, I finally started my first position as Frontend Developer at a media agency in Zurich, where I’m still working.
          While at Bühler & Bühler, I have learned how to use <span class="strong">ES6</span>, <span class="strong">SASS</span>, and a framework named <span class="strong">Foundation</span>.
          Currently I’m learning how to use <span class="strong">Ember.js</span>.
