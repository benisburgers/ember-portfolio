      <p>
        When I was 18, I moved to Canada to study International Relations at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. After graduating in 2018, I began to work outdoors. Specifically, I worked as a rafting guide, ski instructor, and hiking guide in the Swiss Alps and the Rocky Mountains.

        When not outside, I taught myself how to use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and GIT. In January 2019, I finally started my first position as Frontend Developer at a media agency in Zurich, where I’m still working. While at Bühler&Bühler, I have learned how to use ES6, SASS, and a framework named Foundation. Currently I’m learning how to use ember.js.
